# Introduction
This is an eurovision-themed web app where you can explore european (mostly) songs, create spotify playlists, like songs.

# how it works?
Songs are scraped to mongoDB from each country's top 50 tracks from official spotify playlists (small amount of countries don't have those) then artist's country is checked via musicbrainz api. Blacklist is needed for world popular artists because musicbrainz is not always accurate enough. Scraper is included in code if you want to check it out. 

# it is what it is  
Some things might now work as you expect or wish to, if you find something wrong, inform me, I'll improve things in the future. :)
